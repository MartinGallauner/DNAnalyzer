## 2. Clone it üë•

You must move to your fork of the repository and clone (download) it to your local machine using

`$ git clone https://github.com/Your_Username/DNAnalyzer.git`

This creates a local copy of the repository on your machine.

After cloning the `DNAnalyzer` repository on GitHub, use the change directory command on Linux and Mac to go to that
folder.

```python
# This will change directory to a folder DNAnalyzer                                                                   
$ cd
DNAnalyzer
```

Move to this folder for all other commands.

Let us now add a reference to the original 'DNAnalyzer' repository using:

`$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/theabhishek07/DNAnalyzer.git`

This adds a new remote named **_upstream_**.

Examine the modifications using:

```git
 $ git remote -v
 origin https://github.com/Your_Username/DNAnalyzer.git (fetch)                                                      
 origin https://github.com/Your_Username/DNAnalyzer.git (push)                                                        
 upstream https://github.com/theabhishek07/DNAnalyzer.git (fetch)                                                     
 upstream https://github.com/theabhishek07/DNAnalyzer.git (push)
 ```

## 3. Sync with the Remote üîÑ

Remember to keep your local repository up to date with the remote repository.

```python
# Fetch all remote repositories and delete any deleted remote branches
$ git
fetch - -all - -prune
# Switch to main branch
$ git
checkout
main
# Reset local main branch to match upstream repository's main branch
$ git
reset - -hard
upstream / main
# Push changes to your forked DNAnalyzer repo
$ git
push
origin
main
```

## 4. Create a new branch

Whenever you want to make a contribution, use the following command to establish a new branch and keep your `main`
branch uncluttered (i.e. synced with remote branch).

```python
# It will create a new branch <branchname> with name and switch to branch <branchname>
$ git
checkout - b < branchname >
```

To switch to desired branch

```python
# To switch from one folder to other
$ git
checkout < branchname >
```

To add the changes to the branch. Use

```python
# To add all files to branch
$ git
add.
```

Type in a message relevant for the code reviewer using

```python
# This message get associated with all files you have changed
$ git
commit - m
"relevant message"
```

Now, Push your awesome work to your remote repository using

```python
# To push your work to your remote repository
$ git
push - u
origin < branchname >
```
