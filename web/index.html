        This site is still under development. A lot of features have not been added, and some content is missing from
        the website. Please be patient as we roll out changes over the next couple of weeks.

                    <h2 class="primary-dark">Brief Introduction </h2>
                    <p class="secondary-dark text-center">DNAnalyzer identifies proteins, amino acids, start and stop
                        codons, high coverage regions, regions susceptible to neurodevelopmental disorders, transcription
                        factors, and regulatory elements. Researchers are working to extract valuable information from
                        such software to better understand human health and disease. Currently, we are working on
                        developing a Command-Line-Interface (CLI) and Graphical User Interface (GUI) that will enable
                        physicians to quickly and more easily interact with the software, enabling them to identify
                        genetic mutations that may cause disease.</p>

                        <h2 class="primary-dark">Background </h2>
                        <p class="secondary-dark text-center">The human genome is composed of over 3 billion base pairs,
                            making human analysis nearly impossible. Consequently, using powerful computational and
                            statistical methods to decode the functional information hidden in DNA sequences are
                            necessary. The genome is also extremely intricate and contains a plethora of data, which
                            need to be organized and converted into analyzable data appropriately. Current analytical
                            tools and software make it arduous for both geneticists and physicians to do so, thus
                            restricting them from acquiring crucial information to better understand humans.</p>

                        <p class="secondary-dark text-left">

                            &nbsp; 1.Start and stop codons <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Indicate the start and
                            stop of an amino acid. There are 20 different amino acids. A protein consists of one or
                            more<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chains of amino acids (called polypeptides) whose
                            sequence is encoded in a gene.<br>
                            &nbsp; 2.High coverage regions <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regions of a DNA genome
                            that code for a protein and have a relatively high proportion of guanine and cytosine
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nucleotides to the 4 nucleotide bases (45-60%
                            GC-content).<br>
                            &nbsp; 3.Longest genes <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most susceptible to disease
                            implications and are especially linked to neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., autism).<br>
                            &nbsp; 4.Transcription factors <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Proteins that help turn
                            specific genes "on" or "off" by binding to nearby DNA. <br>
                            &nbsp; 5.Regulatory elements <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Binding sites for
                            transcription factors, which are involved in gene regulation. <br>
                            &nbsp; 6.FASTA files (.fa) <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supports multi-line and
                            single-line FASTA database files. Files can either be uploaded or linked to from the web.
                            <br>
                            &nbsp; 7.Command-line interface (Met CLI) <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Methionine
                            command-line interface (abbreviated as Met CLI) is a unified tool for running DNAnalyzer
                            services<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from the command-line. The CLI is a powerful tool
                            for using DNAnalyzer services and scripting a sequence of<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                            commands to execute. You can currently access all the core features present in DNAnalyzer
                            without having to log &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in,although account support will
                            be implemented soon. To get more information on Met CLI installation and <br>&emsp;&nbsp;
                            currently supported commands,refer to Met CLI GitHub repository.
